# DESI tutorials

This repository is for tutorials on simulating and working with DESI data.
There are additional more detailed tutorials within many of the DESI code
repositories; tutorials here are generally for:
* Topics that span individual repositories, e.g. working with data challenge outputs
* Tutorials to be presented at a collaboration meeting where we want to decouple
  updates to the tutorial itself from the desispec, desisim, etc. code versions that
  the tutorial is describing.
* Some tutorials are grouped under a dated directory, e.g. Dec2020, for tutorials
  presented at a specific DESI meeting.

# Getting started

These tutorials use a Jupyter server at NERSC, which provides pre-installed DESI code and access to all DESI data at NERSC without having to download or install anything locally.

First, get a NERSC account following the instructions on the [DESI wiki](https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/Computing/AccessNersc). Then login to cori:
```
ssh cori.nersc.gov
```

Jupyter "kernels" define a specific set of code versions to use.  To install
DESI jupyter kernels from cori.nersc.gov (you only need to do this once):
```
source /project/projectdirs/desi/software/desi_environment.sh 20.8
$DESIMODULES/install_jupyter_kernel.sh 20.8
$DESIMODULES/install_jupyter_kernel.sh master
```

Get a copy of the tutorials on cori.nersc.gov:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/desi/git
cd $HOME/desi/git
git clone https://github.com/desihub/tutorials
```

Login at https://jupyter.nersc.gov and enter your credentials and OTP (One Time Password).
Then, click on the Cori Shared CPU Node "Start" button.
In the file browser on the left, navigate to wherever you cloned the
tutorials repository.  (`$HOME/desi/git/tutorials` in the above commands).
Click on a tutorial to try it out.

If you click on a tutorial and it prompts you to "Select Kernel" from a drop down list, it
means that the default tutorial kernel in GitHub isn't one of the ones that you have already
installed and it is asking you to select from one of the kernels that you do have installed.
In most cases the tutorials will work with the latest release (e.g. 20.8) and
the "master" release (updated nightly, name to switch to "main" in 2021).  Otherwise the
text at the top of the tutorial will tell you which release is needed.  Go back to
cori.nersc.gov, run "$DESIMODULES/install_jupyter_kernel.sh VERSION" for the required version,
and reload the Jupyter page.

# For authors of tutorials

Include at the beginning of the tutorial what is needed as a prerequisite for running the tutorial,
e.g. specific codes, environment variables, datasets.  It's OK to link elsewhere for detailed
instructions (e.g. for how to install DESI code in general).
