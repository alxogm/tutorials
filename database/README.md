# README

This database folder includes the following tutorial notebooks, which require NERSC access.

For publicly accessible databases, please refer to the tutorial [01_getting_started/06_PublicDatabaseAccess.ipynb](../01_getting_started/06_PublicDatabaseAccess.ipynb). However, the functionality and examples contained in the notebooks listed below can still be informative and adapted to work with the public databases.

## How_to_use_SPARCL_at_NERSC.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates how to use the spectral database SPARCL 
together with the DESI production database to find and retrieve DESI DR1 (Iron) spectra. 
It also shows how to convert the results to a list of Spectrum1D objects and to plot some
example spectra.

## spectroscopic-production-database.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates how to use the DESI database of tables including documentation of 
the database content and it showcases a broad range of example queries ranging from simple to 
more complex use cases.
