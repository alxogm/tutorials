# Digging Deeper with DESI Data

**TODO**: Add tutorials or links for more advanced topics as a followup to
the 00_getting_started tutorials.  These could include
  * Downloading data locally
  * Resolution matrix (to be written, but promised in the DR1 paper)
  * Database(s) as an alternative to zcatalog files
  * SPARCL as an alternative to spectra files
  * NOIRLab tutorials in general
  * Targeting bits (https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/blob/main/doc/nb/target-selection-bits-and-bitmasks.ipynb)
  * FastSpecFit
  * More plotting options
  * Reproducing plots from the DR papers
  * etc.
