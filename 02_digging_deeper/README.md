# Digging Deeper with DESI Data

This directory contains tutorials on detailed topics as a followup to the
the [01_getting_started](../01_getting_started) tutorials.  These currently include

  * [RedrockOutputs.ipynb](RedrockOutputs.ipynb) - Working with the spectral classifications and redshift
    catalogs output by the Redrock algorithm.  This includes how to generate the best fit model for each
    spectrum, and how to find the details such as the Nth best fit.
  * [ResolutionMatrix.ipynb](ResolutionMatrix.ipynb) - How to work with the "Resolution Matrix" encoding
    the per-spectrum per-wavelength effective instrument resolution.

Also see

  * The [database](../database/README.md) directory for tutorials specifically about working with the
    DESI database(s) instead of files.
  * [Targeting bits tutorial](https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/blob/main/doc/nb/target-selection-bits-and-bitmasks.ipynb)
    in the [desitarget](https://github.com/desihub/tutorials) repository
  * NOIRLab [Astro Data Lab](https://github.com/astro-datalab/notebooks-latest/tree/master/03_ScienceExamples/DESI/) example notebooks.
  * Scripts and notebooks for generating the plots for data releases are available in the GitHub
    [edrpaper](https://github.com/desihub/edrpaper) and [dr1paper](https://github.com/desihub/dr1paper) repositories.


Future tutorials might include

  * Downloading data locally
  * [FastSpecFit](https://github.com/desihub/fastspecfit) output
  * More plotting options
  * etc.
