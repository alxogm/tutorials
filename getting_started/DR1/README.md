# Getting Started

Welcome to the DESI Getting Started tutorials!

In addition to tutorial Jupyter Notebooks, this folder includes the following:
- [Instructions for installing DESI Jupyter kernels at NERSC](installing_DR1_kernels_at_NERSC.md)
- [Links to reproduce figures from the DR1 Overview paper](figures_from_DR1_paper.md)

## Other useful references

### DESI Data Documentation Website

The [DESI Data Documentation](https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/) website describes data access, data format, data releases, and includes links to technical papers as well as information on data license and acknowledgments.

### DESI Helpdesk

If you have a question, please visit the [DESI User Forum](https://help.desi.lbl.gov).

## Tutorials and data at NOIRLab

Outside NERSC, [NOIRLab provides access and tutorials to some DESI data](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/desi/index.php).
Although only the HEALPixel coadds from the [Latest Data Release](https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/) (check that it is actually pointing to DR1) are served at present, this provides a convenient way to retrieve spectra that could otherwise be spread among many separate files.
