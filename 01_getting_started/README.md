# Getting Started

Welcome to the **DESI Getting Started Tutorials**! 

This resource is designed to guide you through the fundamentals of working with DESI data, providing references and tutorials to help you navigate and make the most of the DESI ecosystem.

The current set of tutorials is based upon DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) data.
Previous tutorials for the Early Data Release (EDR) are archived under the
[EDR/](./EDR) directory.

Start with [00_Setup.md](./Setup) for initial software setup and how to access example data, then proceed with the other tutorials.
